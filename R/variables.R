# Variables

## Simple variables
# Simple variables are valid identifiers that are not language keywords.
# Must contain only letters, and cannot contain spaces.
# Rockstar does not allow numbers or underscores in variable names
# Simple variables are case-insensitive.
# E.g Variable, Tommy, X, Y results

## Common variables consist of one of the
# keywords a, an, the, my or your followed by whitespace and a unique variable name
# which must contain only lowercase ASCII letters a-z.
# The keyword is part of the variable name, so a boy is a different variable from the boy.
# Common variables are case-insensitive.

# E.g. My variable, Your variable, the total

## Proper variables are proper nouns
# any word that isnâ€™t a reserved keyword and starts with an uppercase letter.
# Proper variable names can contain spaces as long as each space is followed by an uppercase letter.
# E.g. Doctor Feelgood, Mister Crowley, Tom Sawyer, Billie Jean.
# Proper variables are case-insensitive apart from the first letter of each word, which must be a capital letter.

## Pronouns
# The keywords
# refer to the last named variable determined by parsing order.
